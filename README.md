#### 1. There are some YouTube videos where your name is pronounced in a different way.
There are YouTube channels where authors care only about monetization.\
I definitely don't recommend videos created with voice synthesizers, e.g. with Google Translate.

#### 2. What is the difference between Przemysław and Przemek?
Polish names, which have Slavic origin, usually have two forms: \
formal, official ones written in documents, and informal ones used every day by friends and relatives.\
The closest analogy that I found is presented below:


| Formal      | Informal  |
| ----------- | ----------|
| Przemysław  | Przemek   |
| Alexander   | Alex      |


#### 3. Which form should I use?
Whichever is easier for you to pronounce or write/copy.

#### 4. How to pronounce Przemysław?
